# Gender_based_voice_recogniton
GenderRecognitionByVoice.ipynb is a Google colab notebook that contains code and documentation for a project that focuses on gender recognition through voice analysis. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms and techniques to predict the gender of a given voice sample.

The notebook is divided into several sections, each of which covers a different aspect of the project. The first section provides an introduction to the project and its objectives. The second section covers data preprocessing, which involves cleaning and formatting the raw audio data to make it suitable for analysis.

The third section covers feature extraction, which involves identifying the most relevant features in the data that can be used to predict gender. The fourth section covers model selection, where different machine learning algorithms are tested and evaluated to determine the best one for the task.

The fifth section covers model training and evaluation, where the selected model is trained on the data and its performance is evaluated using various metrics. The sixth section covers hyperparameter tuning, where the model's hyperparameters are optimized to further improve its performance.

The final section provides a conclusion and summarizes the key findings of the project. It also discusses possible future directions for the project and its potential applications.

Overall, GenderRecognitionByVoice.ipynb is a comprehensive project that demonstrates how machine learning can be used to predict gender based on voice analysis. It provides a detailed overview of the various steps involved in developing such a system, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.
